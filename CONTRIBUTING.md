# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SignWell Ruby SDK!

## Important: This is a generated SDK

This SDK is auto-generated from our OpenAPI specification using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). Most of the code in this repository is regenerated periodically, so **direct code changes via pull requests will be overwritten**.

## How to contribute

### Report a bug in the SDK

If you find a bug in the SDK itself (incorrect types, missing fields, broken serialization, etc.), please [open an issue](https://github.com/Bidsketch/signwell-sdk-ruby/issues) with:

- Ruby version and SDK version
- Code snippet that reproduces the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior

We'll fix it in the generator templates and regenerate the SDK.

### Report an API issue

If the issue is with the SignWell API itself (unexpected responses, errors, missing endpoints), please contact us at [support@signwell.com](mailto:support@signwell.com) or visit [developers.signwell.com](https://developers.signwell.com/).

### Suggest an improvement

For suggestions about SDK design, naming, ergonomics, or missing features, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Bidsketch/signwell-sdk-ruby/issues). We review all feedback and incorporate it into future generator updates.

### Contribute examples

Examples in the `examples/` directory are hand-written and welcome contributions. Feel free to open a PR adding or improving examples.
